Seminar
================================================================================

Seminar is an open-source suite of applications designed for running an
educational course-website. It has the ability to host multiple courses at once,
each with their own collection of assignments, materials, students, etc. Seminar
can also act as an online dropbox for students who wish to turn in assignments
online, and features a gradebook to keep track of students' performance.

Seminar is based on django and is completely written in Python. Deploy Seminar
as you would any other django project.

This project requires the `bs4` (beautiful soup), `markdown`, `piston`, and
`south` modules. Install using `pip` or your own favorite python package
manager.
